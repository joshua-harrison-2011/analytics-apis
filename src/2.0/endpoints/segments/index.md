# Segments endpoint

*This help page describes how to use the segments endpoint. For more information around how to use segments in Reporting API calls, see [Segments](../reports/segments.md) in the Reporting API guide.*

The Analytics 2.0 Segments APIs allow you to retrieve, update, or create segments programmatically through Adobe I/O. The APIs use the same data and methods that are used when working with segments in the UI. See [Segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/seg-home.html) in the Analytics Components user guide for more information.
